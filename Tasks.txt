I do understand copyright enforcement on fangames such as Uranium, Pokemon have to maintain a consistensy and quality across its products (a thing Uranium hadn't on its fakemons and game story/experience)

The history and motivation behind Tamigucho
-
2008-2009
This year, I've thought about an human-like mantis - based in a spider-man figure I had - and imagined how it would behave in the nature.
This same epoch I found a plastic grass and started to move it and imagine this as a brand new Pokémon.
2010
This year, from 2007-2008+, I was a passionate pokéfan.
I had a ball that was able to close and open (just like a pokéball), but it was part of another thing and unrelated to Pokémon. One day, I caught a wild monarch butterfly from my garden with this ball; an hour later, we were at the center of the city and I've released it; and was wondered to see it flying and how magical would be to have the colored Pokémon world into our gray world.
- Brand new Pokémons and 3DS games
- School's mons, Plasma's Battmon, Bulball
- 2013's/2015's Phonemon
- 2016's/present Tamigucho
- 2019 and Qrosstum
- 2022 and the A+B idea Qrosstum was waiting for
- giving a side B to Pokémon, as a fan, is greater than money

Tamigucho site:
- notes about cards
- scans such as Pink&Blue/A&B games
- all descriptions
- notes about all types (including steel, dark, fairy, plastic, rubber and paper) and the challenges about balancing the metagame with the new types and also balancing tritype mons
- note: "Eu sei que a ideia de Tamigucho é muito boa e isso incomoda muita gente. Não que eles realmente queiram defender a franquia Pokémon, mas eles querem defender o próprio ego de ver os pequenos crescerem tanto e serem estes a peça do quebra-cabeça a encaixar em Pokémon, e não eles 19-06-22 00:13" 
- notes: recent tweet https://twitter.com/DaniMesqEN/status/1538371414385995777?t=_HQ7qJAqVsPqSMzI6HTBqQ&s=19
- notes: Tamigucho elementary types depending on body parts (so, elementary types aren't anymore fixed and got more complex and unpredictable); for example, Froquirrel cheeks are rubber type
- diff Pokémon: not all Tamiguchos are born independent; some require parenting
- diff Pokémon: non-fixed and bodily elementary types
- diff Pokémon: more than 1 "owner" possible
- diff Pokémon: list with history of tamers instead of just only OT
ep: important notes about tamigucho: its start, passion, purpose, about A&B games, the brand new elementary types, cross-tamer friendship, etc

Pokémon always had to have a blockchain
Lots of Mews and their history were wasted https://pt.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mew_(Pokémon)
Tamigucho's own history will fix this
